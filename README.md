abstract = {Medication recommendation is a vital task for improving patient care and reducing adverse events. However, existing methods often fail to capture the complex and dynamic relationships among patient medical records, drug efficacy and safety, and drug-drug interactions (DDI). In this paper, we propose ALGNet, a novel model that leverages light graph convolutional networks (LGCN) and augmentation memory networks (AMN) to enhance medication recommendation. LGCN can efficiently encode the patient records and the DDI graph into low-dimensional embeddings, while AMN can augment the patient representation with external knowledge from a memory module. We evaluate our model on the MIMIC-III dataset and show that it outperforms several baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and DDI avoidance. We also conduct an ablation study to analyze the effects of different components of our model. Our results demonstrate that ALGNet can achieve superior performance with less computation and more interpretability.},
